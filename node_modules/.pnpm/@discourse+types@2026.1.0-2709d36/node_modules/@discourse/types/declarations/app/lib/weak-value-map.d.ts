export default WeakValueMap;
/**
 * A Map that holds weak references to its values, allowing them to be
 * garbage collected when no other references exist.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Caches that won't grow forever: cached values are automatically evicted
 *   when no longer referenced elsewhere, preventing memory leaks.
 * - Identity maps: ensures the same key always returns the same object instance
 *   while allowing unused entries to be garbage collected.
 * - Memoization: stores computed results that can be recalculated if evicted.
 *
 * This class provides the same API as the standard Map, but values may
 * disappear if they are garbage collected. Methods like `get()` and iterators
 * will return `undefined` or skip entries whose values have been collected.
 *
 * @template K - The key type.
 * @template {object} V - The value type. Must be an object since WeakRef
 *   only works with objects.
