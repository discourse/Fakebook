 * - Makes screen reader announcements using ARIA live regions with polite/assertive modes
 * - Manages skip links for keyboard navigation
 * - Uses tracked state for reactive announcements
 * - Automatically cleans up announcements after configurable delay
 * - Provides both polite and assertive announcement levels
 *
 * @example
 * // Polite announcement that clears after 2 seconds
 * a11y.announce("Page loaded", "polite", 2000);
 *
 * // Assertive immediate announcement
 * a11y.announce("Error occurred", "assertive", 1000);
