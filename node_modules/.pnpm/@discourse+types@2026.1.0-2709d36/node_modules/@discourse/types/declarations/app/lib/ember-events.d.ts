/**
 * Classic Ember components (i.e. "@ember/component") rely upon "event
 * delegation" to listen for events at the application root and then dispatch
 * those events to any event handlers defined on individual Classic components.
 * This coordination is handled by Ember's EventDispatcher.
 *
 * In contrast, Glimmer components (i.e. "@glimmer/component") expect event
 * listeners to be added to elements using modifiers (such as `{{on "click"}}`).
 * These event listeners are added directly to DOM elements using
 * `addEventListener`. There is no need for an event dispatcher.
 *
 * Issues may arise when using Classic and Glimmer components together, since it
 * requires reconciling the two event handling approaches. For instance, event
 * propagation may not work as expected when a Classic component is nested
 * inside a Glimmer component.
 *
 * `normalizeEmberEventHandling` helps an application standardize upon the
 * Glimmer event handling approach by eliminating usage of event delegation and
 * instead rewiring Classic components to directly use `addEventListener`.
 *
 * Specifically, it performs the following:
 *
 * - Invokes `eliminateClassicEventDelegation()` to remove all events associated
 *   with Ember's EventDispatcher to reduce its runtime overhead and ensure that
 *   it is effectively not in use.
 *
 * - Invokes `rewireClassicComponentEvents(app)` to rewire each Classic
 *   component to add its own event listeners for standard event handlers (e.g.
 *   `click`, `mouseDown`, `submit`, etc.).
 *
 * - Configures an instance initializer that invokes
 *   `rewireActionModifier(appInstance)` to redefine the `action` modifier with
 *   a substitute that uses `addEventListener`.
 *
