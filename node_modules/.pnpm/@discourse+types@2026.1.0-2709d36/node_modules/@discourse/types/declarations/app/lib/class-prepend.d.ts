/**
 * This function provides a way to add/modify instance and static properties on an existing JS class, including
 * the ability to use `super` to call the original implementation.
 *
 * It DOES NOT support modifying the constructor or adding/modifying native class fields. Some decorated fields
 * (e.g. Ember's `@tracked`) can be added/modified, because the decorator turns these fields into getters/setters.
