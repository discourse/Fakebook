/**
 * Use this class whenever you need to upload files or images
 * with Uppy. The class makes it easier to tell Uppy to use certain uppy plugins
 * as well as tracking all of the state of preprocessor plugins. For example,
 * you may have multiple preprocessors:
 *
 * - UppyMediaOptimization
 * - UppyChecksum
 *
 * Once installed with useUploadPlugin(PluginClass, opts), we track the following
 * status for every preprocessor plugin:
 *
 * - needProcessing - The total number of files that have been added to uppy that
 *                    will need to be run through the preprocessor plugins.
 * - activeProcessing - The number of files that are currently being processed,
 *                      which is determined by the preprocess-progress event.
 * - completeProcessing - The number of files that have completed being processed,
 *                        which is determined by the preprocess-complete event.
 * - allComplete - Whether all files have completed the preprocessing for the plugin.
 *
 * There is a caveat - you must call addNeedProcessing(data.fileIDs.length) when
 * handling the "upload" event with uppy, otherwise this mixin does not know how
 * many files need to be processed.
 *
 * If you need to do something else on progress or completion of preprocessors,
 * hook into the onPreProcessProgress(callback) or onPreProcessComplete(callback, allCompleteCallback)
 * functions. Note the onPreProcessComplete function takes a second callback
 * that is fired only when _all_ of the files have been preprocessed for all
 * preprocessor plugins.
 *
 * A preprocessor is considered complete if the completeProcessing count is
 * equal to needProcessing, at which point the allComplete prop is set to true.
 * If all preprocessor plugins have allComplete set to true, then the allCompleteCallback
 * is called for onPreProcessComplete.
 *
 * To completely reset the preprocessor state for all plugins, call resetPreProcessors.
 *
 * See ComposerUploadUppy for an example of a component using this class.
