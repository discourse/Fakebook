/**
 * This service is responsible for managing scroll position when transitioning.
 * When visiting a new route, this service will scroll to the top of the page.
 * When returning to a previously-visited route via the browser back button,
 * this service will scroll to the previous scroll position.
 *
 * To opt-out of the behaviour, individual routes can add a scrollOnTransition
 * boolean to their RouteInfo metadata using Ember's `buildRouteInfoMetadata` hook.
